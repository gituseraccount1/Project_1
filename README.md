Group Project 1:  Analysis of the Worldwide Transit Systems

By: Angelina Vang, Brian Guenther, MaiDao Lor, and Matthew Byron

Overview:
We obtained the “Metro-Systems-Worldwide” database from the Kaggle website (Metro-Systems-Worldwide | Kaggle).   We cleaned and analyzed this data, to relationships that would be useful to an Urban Planner when designing future subway systems.  In addition to accessing aid from tutorial sessions, we also used information from the following websites in this analysis.  This section is followed by the final data analysis.

Final Data Analysis:

Introduction: 
The fundamental intention behind our group project was to understand the efficiency and capability of transit systems across the world. In an era where rapid urbanization and population growth challenge cities, it becomes imperative to have transit systems that can cater to an increasing number of commuters without resulting in inefficiencies or collapse.
Methodology: To achieve this, we analyzed data from a global transit systems csv file, focusing on parameters like ridership, system length, frequency of service, coverage, and capacity. 

Findings:
	Overall Viewpoint: Most developed regions such as North America, Europe, and parts of Asia have transit systems that, while having their own challenges, are generally in pace with their current population demands. However, emerging trends indicate that with an increasing population, the infrastructure will require regular updates and expansions.
	Africa: Our data highlighted that many African nations have transit systems that are already insufficient for current population levels. As urbanization rapidly progresses, many cities in Africa will see a surge in population. Yet, their transit systems largely remain insufficient. 
	India: With one of the world's largest populations, India's metropolitan regions are witnessing a staggering increase in urban inhabitants. Despite significant strides many cities lag in transit infrastructure. The existing systems in numerous Indian cities are overburdened, and the pace of infrastructure development doesn't match the rate of population growth.

Conclusion:
Our analysis confirms that while many regions around the world have recognized the importance of robust transit systems and have invested in them, there are significant gaps, especially in Africa and India. These areas require urgent attention to enhance their transit capacities.
With the dual challenge of urbanization and population growth, it is essential for policymakers, urban planners, and international organizations to collaborate. Strategic planning, funding, and timely implementation of transit projects in these areas will not
